dgl - Darfk's webGL renderer
===

## Synopsis

Cute WebGL framework designed for quick WebGL app development, makes
use of the wonderful [glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net/).

## Features

- Most of the boilerplate of a WebGL app is taken care of by *dgl*
- OBJ files can be read, files must contain verts, texcoords and
  normals. Currently only implements `v, vt, vn, f, o`
- Utility data built in; diffuse and tilemap shaders, plane and cube
  mesh
- Create textures from video, image and canvas with ease


## Motivation

This was a learning exercise, I wanted to create a framework that was
lighter and faster than THREE.js with less features.
